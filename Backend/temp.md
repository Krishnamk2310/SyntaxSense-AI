âœ… Good Code:
```javascript
let a = [1, 2, 3].map(x => x + 1);
```

ðŸ’¡ Review & Improvements:
* âœ” **Concise & Readable:** This is a clear, functional, and idiomatic way to transform an array in JavaScript. The use
of `Array.prototype.map` with an arrow function is highly readable and directly expresses the intent of creating a new
array by applying a function to each element.
* âœ” **Modern JavaScript:** Leverages modern JavaScript features (`map`, arrow functions) which are standard best
practices for array transformations.
* âœ” **Immutability:** The `map` method returns a new array, preserving the original `[1, 2, 3]`. This immutability is a
strong pattern for predictable state management and avoids unintended side effects.
* âœ” **Efficiency:** For this operation, `map` is highly optimized in JavaScript engines, making it an efficient choice
for transforming arrays.

Final Note:
This code snippet is excellent and adheres to high standards of modern JavaScript development. It demonstrates a clear
understanding of array manipulation and functional programming principles. No immediate changes are required; it's
clean, efficient, and maintainable.
